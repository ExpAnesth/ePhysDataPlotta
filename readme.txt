LIST OF CODE FILES

gfplotta - a high-level function which creates plots of continuous ('gap-free') raw time series 

swplotta - a high-level plotting function which creates plots of 'sweeps' of raw time series plus optionally derived data, currently from current clamp recordings with current injection 

PSCplotta - a high-level plotting function for post-synaptic currents (PSCs) which is designed to create i) raw data plots and ii) overlay plots of cutouts thereof 

periburc - performs analysis of and plots current clamp data with hyperpolarizing current injection, computing cell parameters (R, C). It is able to do so for raw data partitioned into bursts and silent periods by threshdetgui. 

peribuexcit - analyzes and plots responses of cells in current clamp mode to sinusodal ramp current injection
